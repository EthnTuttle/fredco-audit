    "summary_points": [
      "FCPS has 1.73 administrators per 1,000 students - the LOWEST among all peers (peer avg: 3.97)",
      "Only 1.26% of FCPS staff are administrators - the LOWEST among all peers (peer avg: 3.13%)",
      "Per-pupil spending is $15,734, which is 10.8% BELOW the Virginia state average of $17,636",
      "Enrollment grew 2.8% over 4 years while admin positions grew only 4.8% (within acceptable range)",
      "One area of concern: Admin SPENDING ratio at 10.4% of expenditures (FY2022 NCES) slightly exceeds 10% threshold"
    ],
    "conclusion": "Based on staffing data, FCPS is NOT over-administered. The district runs a lean administrative operation compared to peers. However, per-position administrative costs should be monitored."
